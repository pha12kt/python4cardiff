# Python 4 Cardiff
Python/Astropy workshop at [STFC summer school in astronomy](http://sites.cardiff.ac.uk/astronomy-summer-school/), Cardiff University on 25 Aug 2015.

This course is a forked version of the excellent course notebooks by [Tom Robitaille](https://github.com/astrofrog/python4vienna).

The aim of this course is to:
* Provide a taste for using Python in science,
* Showcase some of the community created packages for astronomy,
* Highlight differences between Python and other languages,
* Outline some best practices for code writing.

This course is only 2 hours long so many of the details will not be expanded on. These notebooks are available to refresh your memory at any time. If you were a delegate, your [SageMathCloud](http://cloud.sagemath.com) account will remain active.

To use these notebooks on your local machine you will need a working version of `Python 2.7` or `Python 3`.

To install all of the packages you will need for these examples:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Once you have done that:
```
cd notebooks
ipython notebook
```

This should launch the iPython notebook server and open a webbrowser with it running.
